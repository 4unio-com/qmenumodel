QMenuModel - a Qt/QML binding for GMenuModel
(see http://developer.gnome.org/gio/unstable/GMenuModel.html)


= Building =

The build system uses cmake.
To compile, simply invoke cmake and then make, e.g.:

    $ cmake .
    $ make


= Running unit tests =

To run the unit tests, you will need dbus-test-runner. If it wasnâ€™t previously
installed, install it and then re-run cmake. Then run either of these commands:

    $ make test

      - or -

    $ ctest


= Getting code coverage information =

To run the unit tests and generate code coverage information, you need to re-run
cmake with BUILD_WITH_COVERAGE set to ON and then invoke `make lcov`.
This requires lcov to be installed.

    $ cmake -DBUILD_WITH_COVERAGE=ON .
    $ make lcov

This will generate a report (coverage/index.html) which you can view in a
browser.


= API documentation =

To generate API documentation, you need to re-run cmake with GENERATE_DOC set to
ON and then invoke `make qdoc`. This requires qdoc3 to be installed.

    $ cmake -DGENERATE_DOC=ON .
    $ make qdoc

The documentation is generated in the HTML format under doc/html/.


= Examples =

There are examples of how to use QDBusMenuModel in QML, refer to the README file
under the examples/ directory for instructions.
