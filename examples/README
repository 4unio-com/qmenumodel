This directory contains examples that demonstrate how to use the QMenuModel
QML binding in applications.

To export an example menu model on the bus, run 'exportmenu.py'.

To render this menu in a QML application, run 'render-menumodel.qml' in
qmlscene. You will need to inform qmlscene of the location of the QMenuModel
plugin if itâ€™s not installed system-wide, e.g.:

    qmlscene -I libqmenumodel examples/render-menumodel.qml
